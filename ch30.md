# 1
__How are God and man distinguished as to righteousness?__

1. God is perfectly righteous _1 John 1:5_ 
2. Man is perfectly not righteous _Rom 3:22_

## Self-Righteousness of Man

All men have a level of self-righteousness about them. 

_Isaiah 64:6_ 

> Righteousness of man is filthy rags

The good that man does is not good enough in God's eyes. It's a false
righteousness. Man cannot compare himself to other men for gaining favor in
God's eyes. _2 Cor 10:12_. God is the measuring stick of righteousness - not
man.

# 6
__What are the results of imputation of righteousness to man?__

The results of imputation are seen in that the righteousness of God is impututed
to the believer on the basis of the fact that the believer is, through the
baptism of the Spirit, in Christ.

State     Debit(man)     Credit(man)      Debit(Jesus)    Credit(Jesus)
------   ------------   ---------------   --------------  ----------------
unsaved   -R                 -                  -              +R
saved      0                 +R                 -R             +R

# 8
__How does imputation affect standing and state before God?__

The righteousness of God when imputed affects the standing (our position) before
God. 

Our state before God is not affected by imputation, wherein we are still having
a sinful nature.


# 9
__How does imputed righteousness relate to justification?__

Imputed righteousness is the ground of justification.

Forgiveness
: Cancellation of sin

Justification
: the bestowing of merit and standing of Christ
