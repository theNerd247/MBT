title: Chapter 26 - Man, His Fall
---

# 1. Origin of sin

_Gen 1:1-2_

Some speculate that between _vv1-2_ Satan then fell from heaven. There is no
grounding for this argument and there is a debate.

However, the rest of the Bible treats the first few chapters of Genesis as
historical record. 

# 2. State of man before he sinned

Man was created in the form of innocence.

In Romans it refers to Christ as the second Adam. 

How can Christ be a second Adam when he wasn't born with a sin nature? Because
Adam wasn't born with a sin nature.


# 7. How does 1 John 2:16 indicate 3 lines of temptation?

Lust of flesh
: material desire, 

Lust of eyes
: physical desire, impure thoughts

Pride of life
: desire for excessive knowledge, the demeaning of God

# 8.What was the effect on Adam and Eve after they sinned?

Death ("dying you shall die") 

  * seperation from the soul and life on earth
  * seperation from God spiritually.

# 11. State the three imputations set forth in Scripture

imputation
: to charge to ones account, to impute an attribute upon something


_Rom 5:12-14_


1. Adam's sin has been charged to the seed of Adam. Why? Because we would have
   done the same thing. Adam wasn't created perfect; he still had the ability to
   sin.

_Rom 3:23_

# 12. Why is it true that man doesn't becomes sinful by sinning?

We sin because by nature we are sinful. We aren't spiritually dead because of
what we've done, but because Adam sinned.
