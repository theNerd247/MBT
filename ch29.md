__What evidence is given in scripture that a christian has 2 natures?__

Pg. 190.

2 natures in man, one is divine, the other is not. 

Not divine
: the "flesh"
: referred to as just "sin" (with no articles?)

## Flesh

_Rom 7:18_
: "sin which dwells in me"

## Divine 
_2 Pe 1:4_ 
: divine nature, "escape corruption in the world by lust."

## Both
_Gal 5:17_
_1 John 3:9_
_1 Jonn 1:10_

2 natures, one is incapable of sin, the other is.

_How do you be conttrolled by one nature and not the other_?

# 7. 
__Why is the Christian not under the Mosaic system of law?__

_what do we mean by "under"?_

_what about the 10 commandments? Are we under those?_

## Law vs Grace - 2 rules of life

law
: Mosaic law
: ten commandments
: > whole system of government of Israel when in the land which included the
> commandments, the judgments, and the ordinances (_Ex 24:12-31:18_)
: > the governing principles of the yet future kingdom of the Messiah in the
> earth, which are said to be the fulfilling of the law and the prophets
: > any rule of conduct prescribed by men for their own government
: > a aconditional convenant of works
: a principle of dependence on the flesh. The law was an algebra with no
morphism of execution. It provided no way of enablement of observing it.

grace
: legal commands of the mosaic system and the commands to government the
Mossaic kingdom are not now the guiding principles of the Christian
: the child of God under grace has been delivered from the burden of a covenant
of works
: the child of god is not now called upon to live  by the engergy of his own
flesh (he is not on his own to fulfill the law)
: refers to the unmeritted favor which represents the divine method of dealing
with man.
: in contrast with the law, grace is revealed in three different aspects:
1. salvation by grace
2. safekeeping through grace
3. grace as a rule of life for the saved


* God saves sinners by and only by grace
* the divine program of safekeeping through grace demonstrates that through
    grace alone god keeps those who are saved.
* God provides also a rule of life for the saved based on the grace principle.


# 10
__Compare Israels relationship to grace as a rule of life with the Church's
relationship to grace as  rule of life__

Israel
: The law was presumed to be able to be kept without the help of grace

Church
: What he does under grace is not done to secure the favor of God but is done
because he is already accepted in the beloved.
: What the Christian does is not to earn God's favor, but because God is already
pleased by Him, and this is done via grace.

_Are we not supposed to live to please God?_

# 14
__Why is the law principle doomed to failure?__

Because it provides no means of fulfilling itself.

_Rom 6:14_

## Incorrect theories that the Christian can live by the spirit on his own.

1. Christian will be compelled to live to the glory of God if observes
   sufficient rules. It depends on the very thing (the flesh nature) from which
   deliverance is sought.

2. Christian may seek and secure the eradication (completely freed from the
   power thereof) of the old nature and thus permanently freed from the power of
   the sin nature. No scripture upon which this theory is based. God doesn't
   eradicate Satan or the sin nature or the world (3 mighty foes) but provides
   "victory" over them. 

_Victory is now the choice to choose to live by the Spirit or the flesh?_

3. Christian that apart from the Spirit and simply because they are saved they
   can live to the glory of God.

Rom 7:15-8:4_ 
: Proof that number three does not work.
: Paul knew what was good but at his best he was always defeated.

_Rom 7:25_
: deliverance is by the power of Christ.


## Victory over the Spirit

_How do I walk by the spirit so that I do not give into the flesh?_

_Gal 5:16_
: Walk by the Spirit.

* Have a continuous attitude of faith that God is delivering you from the power
    of sin. 

_So what about my struggle to maintain an attitude of forgiveness or not become
irritable or impatient? Can I not "keep a mindful watch on myself" and do my
best to maintain progress towards a better <insert problem of self here>? Or do
I just live "normally" and then trust that God will change my attitude?___ 

### Reasons for life of dependence on the indwelling spirit

1. Under the teachings of grace, a believer faces an impossible heavenly
standard of life.

2. The Christian faces Satan - the world-ruling foe.

3. The Christian posses the old nature which he is powerless to control.
