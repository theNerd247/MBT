title: Chapter 27 - Sin: Itss Character and Universality
---


# 1. What are some inadequate concepts of sin which are sometimes advanced?

* That sin is an illusion

> _If you can explain away God then you don't need to address you immorality_


# 5. What four aspects of sin are presented in the Bible?

1. Personal sin
: ANything that fails to conform to the failure of God

2. The Sin nature of man (The inherited sin)
: The nature of man

3. (Overt) Sin is imputed/reckoned to our account. The sin of Adam that is charged to
   us.

4. The resulting judicial state of sin for the entire human race.

sin
: hamartia
: to miss the mark


    Wickedness -> Bitterness Anger -> Human Good -> Perfect Righteousness
    | ----------------- SIN ---------------------|  |-------GOD----------|

Sin is everything that is not God. When we sin we are missing the perfect
righteousness that is obtained in God alone.

The reason for the existence therein is due the fact that God cannot co-exist
with sin for eternity.

_Rom 6:6_

"knowing this" - aorist tense

ena
: in order that which is a purpose clause

In order for us to no longer be slaves to sin and die to the sin nature in us,
we were crucified with Christ.

The Roman prisons you would drag around a dead person with you. Your old nature
is as if you're dragging around a dead person. When we are saved we are loosed
from this dead man.

## The sin nature

### Patterns
1. Power lust
2. Sexual lust
3. Ego lust

### Trends
1. Lasciviousness - I can do what I want to do (sinful doing) because I'm under
   grace. See _Rom 1_. _Rom 6:15_

2. Asceticism - We feel that we have to make promises to God and punish
   ourselves in order to re-earn God's favor. This is legalism; making payment
   for grace which is saying "I am going to bypass the Christ and pay my way to
   God". see _Rom 2_

   > We punish ourselves to earn favor with God.

_Rom 7:18_

_1 John 1:9_

confess
: homolegeo
: to speak the same as, to agree
: in present tense. This means we continue to confess our sins. Constantly
admitting the sin in our life. If you are in a walking state with God then you
will be during the day admitting that what you've done is sin and that Christ's
blood has covered this.

_Eph 5:18_

filled
: plerao
: to be possessed or controlled.

The only way to not fall back into sin is to have the empowerment of the Holy
Spirit who enters in us instantly upon.

If I walk out of fellowship with God, then we are capable to do anything an
unbeliever will do.


> The most miserable people in the world is not an unbeliever, but an believer
> who is out of fellowship with God.

There is a part of sin nature that is human good. They can do good things, but
their motivation is not of God.
 

## 10. What are the three major imputations?

See the diagram of (+R) above.

1. Adam's sin upon the human race
2. Sin of man to christ
3. Righteousness unto our accounts

Justification
: being declared righteous
: doesn't mean "just as if we never sinned"

Aorist tense is used in _Rom 3_ for the verb justified.

_1 Cor 12_ - for by 1 spirit you have been baptised. Is also in aorist tense.
