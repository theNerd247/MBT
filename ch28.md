__To What extent is salvation the same in every age, and to what extent is the present age more inclusive?__

salvation
: "the whole work of God by which He rescues man from the eternal ruin and doom
of sin and bestows on him the riches of His grace, including eternal life now
and eternal glory in heaven."

1. In every age salvation has been offered through the means of putting their
   trust in God

2. In this age salvation is more revealed in its details and it also includes
   every phase of salvation: indwelling, sealing, and baptism of the Holy
   Spirit.

Jews lived in the shadow of the coming of Christ.

* land
* seed of salvation
* blessing of all nations

_Jer 31:34_
_Isa 66:8_

__How did they live the christian life in the OT__

THey lived by the law. 
Sacrifices.

In todays age we have the 

* sealing
* indwelling
* baptizing
 
All ref with the aorist tense meaning "once for all" in these cases.

__What two universal facts are brought out in Scripure concerning the
relationship of salvation to sin?__

1. It is equal regarding:

  * person 
  * eternal identity
  * severity

Because all sin outrages the character of God.

2. Sin can only be curred on the ground of the shed blood of Christ (in all
   ages)

  * Before Christ they looked forward to His death via sacrifices
  * After Christ we have faith in His death

Forgiveness of sin is not the lenient remitting the penalty of the sin. The
penalty must be payed, and could be payed by a substitute - Christ.

__How did God deal with sin in connection with salvation in the Old Testament?__

## Sin was atoned for - or covered up before the Cross

Blood of sacrifices did not pay the sin. When a sacrifice in the OT was made it
signified the admission of sin by the sinner and the anticipation of the
sacrifice of Christ in the future.

2 NT passages that define "atonement" and "covering"

_Romans 3:25_
: "remission" has meaning of "passing over". 
: Christ's death was the proof that God was righteous in passing over the sins 
of man which were:
  * prior to His death 
  * the reason blood sacrifices were made.

_Acts 17:30_
: God "winked at" or "overlooked" sin

## Sin was dealt with by the Death of Christ since the Cross

_Rom 3:26_

__Distinguish between the finished work of Christ and the saving work of God as
it applies to the individual when he believes.__

The finished work of Christ was the enablement of God to save sinners. It
provided the grounds on which God's perfect grace could be extended to man. 

The saving work of God is done the moment a man believes this includes 10 (out
of 37)
"-tions":

* redemption
* reconciliation
* propitiation
* forgiveness
* regeneration
* imputation
* justification
* sanctification
* perfection
* glorification

## Benefits of salvation

* partakers of inheritance of saints _Col 1:12_
* made accepted in the Beloved _Eph 1:6_
* made righteous of God _2 Cor 5:21_
* made near to God _Eph 2:13_
* made sons of God _John 1:12_
* made citizens of heaven _Phil 3:20_
* made a new creation _2 Cor 5:17_
* made members of the family and household of God _Eph 2:29,3:15_
* made complete in Chist _Col 2:10_
* delivered from the power of darkness and translated into the kingdom of God's
    dear Son _Col 1:13_
* possesses every spiritual blessing _Eph 1:3_ (Is this a "catch-all"
    statement?)

### Three Principles of Self-Esteem

God's truth goes to every area of life.

* Belonging - We belong to Christ and God the Father
* Worth
* Confidence

__Why is it true that the fact that Christ died does not save all men?__

Christ's death only provides the ground of salvation. The believing of man is
what causes man to come into the state of being saved. If Christ's death were
to have saved all men then faith would not be required. 

Evidence for this is seen in our world after Christ's death. If His death was
the only means of salvation then the blessings of the saints as described above
would apply to all men - regardless of their worshipping of God. However, this
is not the case today and therefore there is a discriminating factor that
determines whether a man is saved or not - faith.

## Salvation from Sin of the Saved

<righteousness diagram>

_Ps 66:18_
: This doesn't change my position but my condition

We have a means we can be restored to fellowship (_1 John 1:9_)

With Peter when Christ was washing his feet the fact that peter didn't need to
have a bath was a simple of the priest not needing another bath after his
ceremonial bath when He first became a priest.

__Discuss the scriptural evidence that salvation is conditioned upon faith alone.__

In the NT: 

* 115 passages declare salvation to be dependent on believing
* 35 passages declare salvation to be dependent on faith.

Since "fath" ~= "believing" that's a total of 150 passages regarding faith as
the requirement for salvation.

Some key passages for salvation by faith alone are:

* John 1:12
* John 3:16,36
* John 5:24
* John 6:29
* John 20:31
* Acts 16:31
* Rom 1:16
* Rom 3:22
* Rom 4:5
* Rom 5:1
* Rom 10:4
* Gal 33:22
